# ** Note App with Flutter and SQFlite**

## Getting Started
## **Introduction:**

This is a simple note-taking app built with Flutter, a powerful open-source framework for developing natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. The app utilizes SQFlite, a lightweight NoSQL database solution for mobile apps, to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user-generated notes.

Features:

**Create**: Add new notes with a title and content.
**Read**: View and scroll through your saved notes.
**Update**: Edit and modify your existing notes.
**Delete**: Remove unwanted notes from your collection.
